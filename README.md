# Create

This CLI allows you to create a template for your project, whether it's an express, React, or fullstack application.

## Usage

[Create express api with Typescript:](https://github.com/JeriRov/express-ts-template.git)

```sh
npx @artemmahey/create -e name-of-app
```

[Create react app with Typescript:](https://github.com/JeriRov/react-ts-template)

```sh
npx @artemmahey/create -r name-of-app
```

[Create fullstack app with Typescript:]()
